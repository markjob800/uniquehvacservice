      <p>"Unique did a fantastic job fixing my family’s AC unit! They’re professional, friendly, and very knowledgeable. They explained why the unit was leaking, gave helpful tips on maintaining it, and had it running perfectly in no time. We haven’t had any issues since, and if anything ever comes up again, I’m confident they would take care of it. I highly recommend them!."</p>
